## Goals

* Binary tree ADT
* Binary tree implementation

## ADT

### Definition 1

Set of nodes and a set of edges.

1. One node is the *root*
1. Every node *n*, except the *root*, is connected to exactly one parent
1. A unique path exists between the root and each node

### Definition 2

A tree is either empty or consists of a *root* and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree.

### Traversal

## Implementation

### Traversing a tree

* Pre-order
* In-order
* Post-order
* By layers
* Recursive vs iterative

## Summary

* Binary tree ADT
* Binary tree implementation
