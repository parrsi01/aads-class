# Anomaly counter

Implement the *flood fill* algorithm to count number of anomalies in a picture.

Your program must count the number of anomalies (stars, spots, etc) visible in a bitmap image. An image consists of pixels, and each pixel is either black or white (represented by the characters Â· and *, respectively). All black pixels are considered to be part of the background, and each white pixel is considered to be part of an anomaly. White pixels that are adjacent vertically or horizontally are part of the same anomaly.

Each data file (*anomalycounter{n}* in *data/projects/anomalycounter/*) represents a single image as rows and columns of pixels.

For each test case, count the number of anomalies in the image.
