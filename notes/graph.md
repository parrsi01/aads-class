## Goals

* ADT
* Implementation
* Algorithms
* Problems

## ADT

* *Graph* is an abstract data type that implements the mathematical concept
* Set of vertices and edges
  * an edge may be directed or undirected
* Graphs are studied in discrete math and graph theory. The word *graph* was first used in this sense by James Joseph Sylvester in 1878.

## Implementation

Graphs can be represented as either *adjacency matrix* or *adjacency list*

### Factors to consider

* Size (vertices and edges) of the problem (graph)
* Density
  * matrix grows quadratically as number of vertices increases
  * list grows quadratically if the graph is dense
* Algorithms
  * DFS are easier to implement using a matrix
  * operation `__contains__` is easier to implement using a list
* Frequence of modification
  * Add/remove edge
  * Modify vertex attributes

### Python implementation

* *pythonds3.graphs*
* *networkx*

## Algorithms

* Bellman-Ford algorithm (1956)
* Kruskal’s algorithm (1956)
* Prim’s algorithm (1957)
* Dijkstra’s shortest path first algorithm (1959)
* Floyd-Warshall algorithm (1962)
* A\* search (1968)
* PageRank (1998)

## Problems

* Network flow problem
* Travelling salesman problem
* Minimum spanning tree

## Summary

* ADT
* Implementation
